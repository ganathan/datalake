Data lake as a service (DaaS) is a fedarated data lake solution. Organizations have mutliple departments and each department tends to host their own data in a data lake owned by them. Although creating a single data lake for the enterprise is ideal, but is almost always a challenging task.

This solution helps federate the data lake and allows effective governance.
